Readme for Grand Parade
==============

How to:
--------------

1. mvn clean test
2. You can pretty much execute just a test if you want, obviously.

Hey folks, have couple of issues:
1. No allure reports, dunno some bug with a allure plugin + junit, took me lot of time time to, I didn't make it.
2. Issue with hover over game, not sure why but jQuery does not really wanna work with java out of a box, so I tried actions,
but no luck, probably because of angular, not sure, but those game-elements are tricky on the page.

I should've picked some stuff like protractor with JS or cypress for those purposes, but would take me more time to do it.
Other than that it should be fine.
Any feedback is welcome, even the negative one. Feedback is feedback, right?
